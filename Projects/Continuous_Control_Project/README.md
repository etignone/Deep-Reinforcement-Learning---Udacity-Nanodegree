# Continuous Control

For this project, you will train a DDPG agent to solve the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment provided by [Unity-ML Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents), an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations created using the [Unity Editor](https://unity3d.com/) to serve as environments for training intelligent agents.
