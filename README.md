# Reinforcement Learning

For this project, you will train a Deep-Q-Networks agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in an environment [Unity-ML](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents), an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents.
